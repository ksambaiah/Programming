# What makes good programmer to great

 - It is not only important to write code you need to take care of proper comments
 - Name variables properly, not just **i** **j** or **k**, appropriate to the requirement
 - If you modify the code, modify comments too.
 - Don't be very clever in the comments
 - Log appropriately, some one is going to debug the issue based on the logs, if you don't do proper logging he needs to read code which is difficult times.
 - Manage error handling with appropriate exceptions.
