# Why Linux why not Windows

An experienced person it doesn't make much difference between Windows and Linux I worked almost all Linux only. What I like about Linux?

 1. File system
 2. Tool set where it does one task and one task well and behaves well with other tools
 3. Easy to learn and grasp how it works

## What will I cover here
For freshers I will cover shell, file system, grep, find, sed etc 
For experienced I will cover installing packages etc.
Unix Programming Environment book by Kernighan and Pike chapters some of them
