# Welcome to Sambaiah Kilaru git page

I am Sambaiah Kilaru working as devops engineer from last 25 years starting with Linux administrator, Bigdata engineer and devops. This repository is my intention to teach freshers during the college time into Programming, Linux and Networking.


## Haskell

You can ask why I included haskell when very very few organisations use it. Haskell is such a language it helps in dividing your problems into smaller functions. Mathematician inside me also have urge to do it in haskell and functional programming way.

## What is different from others
Freshers concentrate mostly on writing algorithms, it is important to use log files, log rotation, command line options and proper way to handle exceptions.
