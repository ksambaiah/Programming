# Recursion

Recursion is one of the best technique and mastering is very very important.
Some times recursion doesn't do good job, if we keep on referring to itself and best example is fibonacci numbers. Computing fibonacci number 9 involves computing fib 8 and fib 7.
Computing fib8 involves computing fib 7 and fib6.
Computing fib7 involves computing fib6 and fib5

We end up computing fib7 twice, fib6 twice etc causing tail recursion. To solve this problem we have dynamic programming technique
